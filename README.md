wordpress-mvc
=============

MVC Framework written to work on top of WordPress and Genesis

##Currently works as a Genesis Child them but in progress of being converted to a plugin which works on any WordPress theme.

More useful readme and documentation coming soon. Up until 9/4/13 this was a private project used on many live 
WordPress sites. It is being made public in hopes of helping other developers out there who love MVC.


#TODO for transfer to plugin

##create an install script to generat the proper MVC folders and some starting Files like Post.php and Page.php

##Check for existing MVC folders and do not overwrite any files during the plugin install

##Check for write access to theme folder and display a warning with a manual generation link

##Allow for turning off auto MVC and auto Widgets etc by using a define in the config file

##Check for existing widgets folder and automatically ad the define to the config to turn off auto widgets

##remove unneeded formating options like content wrap

##Move things like slideshows and carousels into their own plugin perhaps for later use one day
