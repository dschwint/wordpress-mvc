wordpress-mvc
=============

MVC Framework written to work on top of WordPress and Genesis

##Currently works as a Genesis Child them but in progress of being converted to a plugin which works on any WordPress theme.

More useful readme and documentation coming soon. Up until 9/4/13 this was a private project used on many live 
WordPress sites. It is being made public in hopes of helping otheres out there who love MVC.
